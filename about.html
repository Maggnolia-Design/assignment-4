         <h2>about me</h2>
         <h1>My hobby is art and my major is design + interactive media.</h1>
         <p>My name is Maggie Zhang and I am a freshman at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.  Most of my background is in the fine arts (sketching and oil-painting), but I enjoy accumulating new skills and exploring new mediums.  Now, as a Design+Interactive Media major, I'm undergoing another personal evolution by increasing my exposure to digital work.<br><br>I've taken formal lessons in sketching and oil-painting for years, and I particularly love depicting facial features and portraits. In recent years, I tried more playful styles, subject, and mediums (such as oil-pastels, calligraphy, and encaustics).  On the digital side, I've created posters, fliers, vector art, and an identity manual.</p>
